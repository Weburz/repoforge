title: Introducing Terox
---

Terox allows its users to use pre-defined templates to build their next projects
without writing boilerplate code from scratch repeatedly.

Besides, creating boilerplate code for its users to develop projects, it also
allows room for automation like invoking scripts before/after generating the
boilerplate.

With Terox, you can create templates of your boilerplate code once and allow it
to reproduce them whenever you want it again in the future for your projects. No
longer do you have to waste time and effort to setup a fresh new repository from
scratch and copy boilerplate code/content from one repository to another. Let
Terox reproduce the environment for you while you sip a cup of coffee (or tea).

## Getting Started

You can get started with using Terox by following the
[official installation guide](/terox/usage-guide/installation) to download Terox
to your local development environment.

## Why Use Terox & Not its Alternatives?

Terox offers the following advantages over existing alternatives like
[Cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io) and/or
[Create-React-App](https://create-react-app.dev).

1. Terox is shipped as a single binary compiled for many different platforms
   like Windows, Linux and MacOS. You need not rely on a runtime interpreter
   like [Python](https://www.python.org) or [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) unlike
   the alternatives.

2. Terox is actively maintained, updated with new features (as requested) and
   actively used in production environments (we use it at Weburz ðŸ˜‰).
